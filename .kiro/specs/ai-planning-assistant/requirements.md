# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Planning Assistant is a web application that allows users to create and manage plans using natural language input. Plans are embedded directly in the UI as editable, persistent elements. AI agents work behind the scenes to enhance plans by adding structure, scheduling items to calendars, and making intelligent suggestions. All AI-generated changes are presented to users for approval, ensuring user control while leveraging AI capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input plans using natural language, so that I can quickly capture my planning ideas without rigid formatting constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types or speaks a plan in natural language THEN the system SHALL accept and process the input regardless of format or structure
2. WHEN a user submits natural language input THEN the system SHALL create a persistent plan element in the UI
3. WHEN a user creates a plan THEN the system SHALL make it immediately editable and accessible in the interface
4. IF a user provides incomplete information THEN the system SHALL create the plan with available details and allow for later enhancement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI agents to automatically enhance my plans, so that I can benefit from intelligent structuring and organization without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates or updates a plan THEN AI agents SHALL analyze the content and generate relevant enhancements
2. WHEN AI agents process a plan THEN they SHALL add structure, categorization, and scheduling recommendations
3. WHEN AI agents identify calendar-worthy items THEN they SHALL prepare calendar entries for user approval
4. IF a plan contains actionable items THEN AI agents SHALL suggest task breakdowns and timelines

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to review and control AI-generated changes, so that I maintain authority over my plans while benefiting from AI assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI agents generate changes to a plan THEN the system SHALL present all changes clearly to the user before applying them
2. WHEN the system shows AI-generated changes THEN the user SHALL be able to accept, decline, or edit each change individually
3. WHEN a user declines AI suggestions THEN the system SHALL learn from the feedback and adjust future recommendations
4. IF AI agents add calendar entries THEN the user SHALL approve them before they are committed to their calendar

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want plans to be persistent and always accessible in the UI, so that I can quickly reference and modify them without navigation overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a plan THEN it SHALL remain embedded and visible in the main interface
2. WHEN a user has multiple plans THEN the system SHALL organize them in an accessible layout without hiding content
3. WHEN a user clicks on any plan element THEN it SHALL become immediately editable in place
4. IF a user makes changes to a plan THEN the system SHALL save changes automatically and trigger AI processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want contextual AI assistance through chat, so that I can get help while maintaining shared context with my visible plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the chat interface THEN the AI SHALL have full context of all visible plans and recent changes
2. WHEN a user asks questions about their plans THEN the AI SHALL reference specific plan elements and provide relevant assistance
3. WHEN a user requests help via chat THEN the AI SHALL be able to suggest modifications to visible plans
4. IF the user and AI discuss plan changes THEN both SHALL maintain alignment on the current state of all plans

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want my plans to be accessible across devices, so that I can manage my planning from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in from any device THEN the system SHALL synchronize all plans and progress data
2. WHEN a user makes changes on one device THEN the system SHALL update data across all connected devices in real-time
3. WHEN a user is offline THEN the system SHALL allow basic plan viewing and editing with sync upon reconnection
4. IF there are sync conflicts THEN the system SHALL present options for resolution to the user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track my progress and adherence to plans, so that I can understand my patterns and improve my consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes planned activities THEN the system SHALL record completion status and timestamps
2. WHEN a user views plan history THEN the system SHALL display progress metrics and adherence patterns
3. WHEN the system detects low adherence THEN it SHALL suggest plan adjustments or motivational strategies
4. IF a user consistently skips certain activities THEN the AI SHALL recommend plan modifications
