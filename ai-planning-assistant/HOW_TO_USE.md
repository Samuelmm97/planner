# How to Use the AI Planning Assistant

## Overview

The AI Planning Assistant is a web application that helps you create and manage plans using natural language input. AI agents work behind the scenes to enhance your plans with structure, scheduling, and intelligent suggestions, while you maintain full control over all changes.

## Getting Started

### Creating Your First Plan

1. **Open the application** in your web browser
2. **Find the natural language input area** (text box or voice input)
3. **Type or speak your plan** in everyday language, for example:
   - "I want to start working out 3 times a week"
   - "Plan a healthy meal prep for next week"
   - "Create a morning routine that includes meditation"
4. **Submit your input** - the system will create a persistent plan element in the UI

### Understanding Plan Types

The AI automatically recognizes different types of plans:
- **Routines** - Daily or weekly habits and schedules
- **Meals** - Meal planning and nutrition goals
- **Workouts** - Exercise plans and fitness routines
- **Schedules** - Time-based activities and appointments
- **Custom** - Any other type of plan you create
